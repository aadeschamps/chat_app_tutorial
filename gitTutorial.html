		<h1>Working with Git and GitHub</h1>
		<p><b>Git</b> is a version control system that allows you to stage and store various versions of your code. This then allows you to revert to a working version of your code, or allow others to work on it with you.</p>
		<p><b>GitHub</b> is kind of like the social media hub of Git. It is a cloud-based site that allows users to store their code, usually for others to see and use to create other applications and websites with that code.</p>
		<p>For now, we're going to focus on the basics of creating a <b>repository</b>, or <b>repo</b>, as well as the fundamentals of creating a repo on GitHub and adding files to that repo.</p>

		<h2>Creating a Local Git Repo</h2>
		<p>The first thing you need is to create a local repo on your hard drive. You can do this by opening your terminal and navigating to your current project file, then initializing a git repo, like so:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint"><code>
			$ cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
			$ git init
		</pre></code>
		<p><i>**As you may have noticed, the command for git is simply</i> <code>git</code>.</p>
		<p>Congrats! You now have a local git repo.</p>
